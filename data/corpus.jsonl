M) Movement of Funds between internal funds within the Internal Funding Framework: 36 1) The Finance and Business Committee and Senate shall have the authority to move funds between internal funds within the Internal Funding Framework (other than USSA, given it is a lock-in) a) This should only be done in emergency funding situations OR if a particular fund within the Internal Funding Framework is deemed particularly dormant in a fiscal year as determined by the judgement of the Finance and Business Committee and Senate. i. The fact that certain internal funds within the Internal Funding Framework (e.g. Sports Teams, Culture/Grads) are primarily granted in the latter part of the fiscal year should be kept in mind when making judgements. b) Such movement between internal funds within the Internal Funding Framework must be approved by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of both the Finance and Business Committee and the Senate. N) The High-Impact Projects (HIP) Fund may receive an allocation each year, wholly at the discretion of the budgetary process. The HIP Fund shall not submit a budget proposal, nor be entitled to funds in any given year. At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the HIP Fund’s rollover shall automatically be processed, as though as a rollover request was made. In order to access funding from the HIP Fund, a project proposal must be approved by three-fourths (3⁄4) vote of the Senate, and must abide by the following: 1) Failure to meet and maintain these criteria will result in the forfeiture of project funding. Funding is not guaranteed for project proposals that meet this criteria; rather, all projects must continuously meet these criteria to remain eligible for funding. The ultimate authority for discretion on project funding is solely granted to the Senate, assuming the following criteria are met: a) High-Impact Projects must be tangible. A project must deliver and demonstrate meaningful impact and results for the student body of UCSB, or the surrounding community in Isla Vista. Projects may not be primarily or solely for the benefit of the University administration, faculty, or staff. b) High-Impact Projects must be time-bound. A project must set and abide by a timeline of results, indicating dates at which major milestones will be accomplished—including but not limited to project completion. This criterion relates to tangibility; results at each milestone must be documented and delivered to relevant stakeholders. c) High-Impact Projects must be transformative. A project must provide a result that is not currently available to the Associations’ stakeholders. Projects must demonstrate that their work is unique in the Association and UCSB community, and that no other group is currently accomplishing the project’s goals. 2) High-Impact Projects must be directed by a HIP Team. Non-liaison members of HIP Teams must be indicated in the project proposal, and HIP Team members must be current students, staff, or faculty at ASUCSB or UCSB. Each HIP Team must contain, at least: a) One (1) Project Manager. This role possesses sole executive authority over the project, and ultimately bears responsibility for its goals, liability, property, staff, etc. b) One (1) Project Administrator. This role assists the Project Manager in recording and documenting the project’s progress and administration. c) One (1) Senate Liaison. The Senate Liaison is responsible for coordinating the 37 project with the Senate, and regularly and accurately representing its progress. The Senate Liaison is not responsible for the successful completion of the project. The Senate Liaison must be a current member of the Senate, and shall be appointed by the Senate First-President Pro-Tempore within one (1) week of project funding approval. d) Other roles, as outlined in the project proposal. e) HIP Team members may be replaced throughout the duration of"}

HIP Honoraria will only be awarded upon the completion of a project, and may be negatively amended if the project has been found to have been partially completed, as described in By-Laws Article IV Section 3 (N, 4, b, ii), below. HIP Honoraria will not be awarded for projects that have wholly failed to meet their objectives. 3) Project Proposals: a) For funding to be considered from the HIP fund, a project proposal must be submitted to the Senate for consideration. The process for such submissions shall be published by the Presiding Officer of the Senate, at their discretion. b) Each project proposal shall include, but not be limited to: i. The specific issue the project seeks to address. ii. The tangible, time-bound, and transformative goals and milestones of the project. These goals and milestones will be used to evaluate project success. For more information, see By-Laws Article IV Section 3 (N, 1, a-c) above. iii. The plan for achieving these goals and milestones. iv. Thorough research of the issue, if applicable, and detailed budget information. v.

This MOU shall include the specific responsibilities and liability of members of the proposed HIP Team, and any relevant commitments made by the Association, which shall not contradict this statute or any other section of the Legal Code of the Associated Students. Other stipulations may be made, as indicated in the approved project proposal. Upon the affixation of signatures by all members of the proposed HIP Team, the A.S. Executive Director, the Senate First and Second Presidents Pro-Tempore, the Internal Vice-President, and the A.S.

SECTION 2. A.S. LOBBY CORPS A) Charge of the Board: Associated Students Lobby Corps is an organization that strives to unite activism, professionalism, and strategic action planning to advocate for student needs while implementing local, state-wide, and national campaigns. We strive to represent student interests in political institutions by fighting for student rights, people-powered democracy, and affordable, accessible, and quality higher education for all. Lobby Corps seeks to mirror the unique, diverse, and forward thinking nature of the UCSB community, and advocate for student needs – be it in Washington D.C., or Isla Vista. To this end, Lobby Corps will collaborate with other student organizations in order to educate, assist, and train student leaders so they can advocate for issues affecting all students especially those of underrepresented communities. As a means to promote this goal, we will seek to empower any AS or OSL group that wishes to participate in a lobby training workshop so they can more effectively advocate for general student interests. Lobby Corps is an ASUCSB unit that researches and analyzes pending local, state, and Federal legislation, programs, and policy. The goal of Lobby Corps is to influence legislators and decision-makers in order to shape public policy that reflects our diverse 340 student community’s needs and priorities as well as to give students the opportunity to gain real-world political, legislative, and organizing experience.

This commission will offer a platform of coalition-building for cultural student organizations by connecting representatives from these groups to strengthen a united front in tackling intersectional issues, to hold the institution accountable to their equity, diversity, and inclusion measures, and to ensure the sustainability of these student-led efforst for institutional changes. We will combat the effects of racial and cultural marginalization on an institutional and systemic level through cultural programming, advocacy initiatives, and educational programming to increase cross-cultural understanding and solidarity, and to positively uplift the climate of the campus and the local Isla Vista community. 1) Cultural Representation: a) Cultural Programming: Providing more visibility for students of color organizations and the honoring of their cultures on campus. Creating spaces for the cultivation of joy, connecting students of color with community and resources on and off campus; and building cross-cultural solidarity. Examples: i. Weekly: The TakeOver: One Love – Every Friday from 12pm-1pm at Storke Plaza to showcase the beauty and vibrance of the various cultures in the UCSB community. Offering free food and space for student orgs and campus services to table and share resources. ii. Quarterly: Welcome Back Concert (targeting underrepresented students) – Every Falll; Cultural Renaissance – Every Spring. iii. A.S.

There will be a collaboration with on-campus and off-campus entities towards this joint cultural programming (such as MCC, KCSB, Media Services, IVRPD, etc.) b) This commission pushes against traditional campus discriminatory policies against cultural practices. For example, SEAL does not allow funding for decorations, but these may be important for cultural practices and ceremonies.

Example: War in Tigray. c) Reparations for the Black community at the UC level. i. In the same light as reparations given to federally recognized Native/Indigenous tribes within the UC as of Fall 2022. ii. In line with the campus mission of equity, diversity inclusion: increasing recruitment, enrollment, and retention efforts of Black population (students and faculty). d) Food Justice e) Housing Accessibility and Affordability f) Disability Justice 3) Advocacy and Providing Institutional Accountability a) Follow up on the demands made by BIPOC organizations to the Chancellor and administration for institutional changes and any new demands issued by this commission. b) Providing Liaisons to departments and offices that are said to cater to issues of equity and inclusion such as Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, for the sake of transparency, accountability, and inclusion of students of color voices for feedback to their practices. c) Providing Liaisons to departments and offices created by student activisim, such as all Ethnic Studies Departments, and Office of Black Student Development, for accountability for the services to the student groups who advocated for them, to ensure inclusion of student voices in their hiring process and in the quality of the offered services. d) Gathering student involvement (as interns or volunteers) for committee work such as participation in hiring committees in various departments. 4) Education: Workshops, Film Screenings, Panel"}

PURPOSE OF ASSOCIATED STUDENTS PEARMAN FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM The Associated Students at the University of California, Santa Barbara commits to supporting and advocating for student interests on the Santa Barbra campus, in Isla Vista, the State of California and nationwide. Through this extensive fellowship program, we expose fellows to a plethora of issues as well as teach them a variety of ways to address these issues. The A.S. Fellowship Program is designed to allow interested and highly motivated UCSB students a well-organized and efficient introduction to the association, its structure, administrative staff as well as any other pertinent information surrounding Associated Students and the UCSB community. The A.S. Fellowship Program develops students’ leadership skills through tangible projects that showcase their hard work and achievements. In many cases these skills do not result from a typical academic classroom experience and resources to cultivate these skills are often not readily accessible. It also serves as an excellent preparation for students who want to continue working in Associated Students. The A.S. Fellowship Program places fellows in an office that reflects their passions (as determined through their application). From there, they will work with the Chiefs of Staff and committee members of that office to create and execute projects that reflect the goals of the office and of the association. SECTION 2.

If a fee is put on the ballot by petition, a vote of fifty percent plus one (50% + 1) shall be necessary for the adoption of the fee. If a fee is put on the ballot by a vote of the Senate a vote of two-thirds (66.67%) shall be necessary for the adoption of the fee.

CODE OF CONDUCT Discourteous behaviors may undermine morale and lead to stress; disrupt the functioning and cohesiveness of the association; interfere with individuals’ ability to learn, cooperate, and work; and undermine a culture that is civil, ethical, and that honors compliance. A) Summary: 1) Abusive Conduct/Bullying Behavior in violation of this policy is prohibited and will not be tolerated. The Association encourages anyone who is subject to or becomes aware of Abusive Conduct/Bulling behavior to promptly report it. The Association will respond swiftly to reports of Abusive Conduct/Bullying and will take appropriate action to stop, prevent, correct, and address the harm caused by such behavior. B) Definitions: 1) Association: Any space where ASUCSB business is conducted or occurs, in connection with the Associated Students program or activity (including, for example, BCU meetings, fellowship programs, elections, and off-campus activities). Concurrently, can refer to the entity of ASUCSB as a whole 2) Abusive Conduct/Bullying: For purposes of this policy, abusive conduct and bullying are synonymous. Abusive Conduct/Bullying is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct that denies, adversely limits, or interferes with an individual’s participation in or benefit from the activities, duties, or other responsibilities of the Association, and creates an environment that a reasonable person would find intimidating or offensive and unrelated to the Association’s legitimate educational and business interests. 3) Complainant: An individual who alleges and/or has been reported to have been subjected to Abusive Conduct/Bullying. 4) Reasonable Person Test: The basis for determining whether the conduct at issue rises to the level of Abusive Conduct/Bulling is whether a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would find the conduct hostile or offensive given the totality of the circumstance. Although the intention of the person responsible for the conduct may be considered, is not determinative. a) We, the Associated Students of UCSB, official recognize that UCSB’s student population comprises a myriad of different cultures, customs, backgrounds, and traditions. The reasonable person, as set in Vaughn v. Menlove (1837), establishes an objective standard and sees strong precedence in the US justice system, but fails to fully grasp the multicultural reality of contemporary college campuses. Therefore, an alternative approach"}

SENATE AGENDA AND MINUTES Students who attend Senate meetings shall be given priority to speak over the orders of the day. The A.S. Internal Vice President must recognize any student in the audience who wishes to speak once before any Senate members on the speakers list have the chance to speak. A) The Standard Agenda: Call to Order A) Meeting Business A-1) Land Acknowledgement We ask you to join us in acknowledging the Chumash Peoples, their Elders, both past and present, as well as their future generations. We would like to take this opportunity for us all to reflect on how the work we do here today, in our search for knowledge, our opportunities to teach, and every day, in our chosen fields, affects these lands and the peoples of these lands that we work with and research to protect. We acknowledge that this University system was founded upon exclusions and erasures of many Indigenous peoples, including those on whose lands this institution is located, the villages and unceded lands of the Chumash people. This UCSB Administration has failed to faithfully and dutifully support the traditional custodians of these lands, Chumash people and Indigenous students, through their continued support of Mauna Kea. As we work together to prevent further damage to these lands and waters that support not only our livelihoods, recreation, lifestyles, research, and education, we remember that the Chumash peoples of this area have been separated from these lands, unable to maintain livelihoods as they should, unable to recreate traditionally, unable to maintain their traditional lifeways freely, and unable to have the same access to their lands that we are provided, to do their own traditional research and educate their future generations. The Chumash people are comprised of the descendants of Indigenous peoples removed from their Island of origin Limuw (Santa Cruz), Anyapac (Anacapa), Wima (Santa Rosa) and Tuqan (San Miguel), subjugated by 5 missions during Spanish colonization of the Central Coast, from Malibu to Morro Bay and inland to Bakersfield. The Villages, upon which this University sits, were a safe haven for maritime travelers. A place alive with trading, hospitality, and abundance. A place where knowledge of and from the surrounding areas, far and wide, was shared with all people of this place and its many visitors. A traditional place of sharing knowledge and education. A tradition this University has an obligation to remember. Many of the projects and research conducted by this University are within the traditional territory of the Chumash Peoples, and/or affect other Indigenous peoples in their territories and in spite of all of this, each Tribe, Council, Clan, and Band is working diligently to restore and 432 continue their traditional stewardship practices on these lands and heal from this historical trauma. The damage that has been done and continues to be done by not sharing the true history and legacy in"}

The damage that has been done and continues to be done by not sharing the true history and legacy in this place and others, and by the exploitation of the Natural Cultural Resources of these areas, can never be erased, there is no mitigation or research project that can make their communities whole again. But we can do better! As educators, friends, and allies, together, we can acknowledge the mistakes and atrocities of the past and move forward in remembrance and relationship with the local Chumash peoples and other Indigenous peoples, to facilitate their process of healing by making sure that our processes here make room for their Chumash and Indigenous voices to be heard, their Traditional Ecological Knowledge of these territories to be listened to and their peoples to be a part of the healing of these lands and waters, as well as themselves. This acknowledgment, though brief and in no way complete, demonstrates a commitment by this institution and their educators, to begin the process of creating a relationship with the local Chumash and Indigenous Communities and work to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism. We come together today to acknowledge, stand up for, and give voice to, the unceded lands and waters of the Chumash and all their peoples.

Requisition Process 1. Checks 2. Purchase Orders 3. Journal Entries (BCU speciﬁc) 46 There are three different types of requisitions: Checks Checks are the most common form of requisition for A.S. BCUs and SEAL RCOs. Checks are primarily used for reimbursements, which occurs after you are approved for funding, pay for the approved expenditure out of your pocket, and then receive the approved amount back from the Association. For requisition forms resulting in checks, make sure to attach the original receipt as well as the meeting minutes where the funding was approved. Language and instructions on ﬁlling out requisition forms was created by Adam Majcher (‘23), former Chair of the AS UCSB Finance & Business Committee. We thank Adam for his help! Checks Checks Checks are used for reimbursements. When submitting a requisition for a check, you must include: 1. Attached original itemized receipts (no scans, pictures, or photocopies) 2. Meeting minutes where the funds were approved 3. Signed & completed (pink) requisition form 48 Purchase Orders Purchase Orders (POs) are promises by organizations to pay for services or goods. POs require a ﬁnal invoice to be submitted to invoices@as.ucsb.edu in order for the payment to be processed. POs take two forms: ● Open POs - When a speciﬁc amount of money is set aside for recurring charges. This helps to encumber recurring costs. ● One-Time POs - Used to streamline the requisition process for vendor payments. Please submit One-Time POs to A.S. UCSB Admin with all necessary documentation (complete requisition form, meeting minutes, and ﬁnal invoice from the vendor). In general, Purchase Orders are the most effective way to bypass paying out of pocket and going through the check reimbursement process. Language and instructions on ﬁlling out requisition forms was created by Adam Majcher (‘23), former Chair of the AS UCSB Finance & Business Committee. We thank Adam for his help! Purchase Orders Purchase Orders Purchase Orders in this essence are a “promise to pay”. PO’s do not require any documentation to accompany the initial requisition, but payment will not be completed until ﬁnal invoices are received When submitting a requisition for a purchase order include: 1.

Journal Entries Gateway Order and Gateway Vendor Blanket represent payment through UC Santa Barbara’s Gateway Vendor portal. See additional slides later!

PHILANTHROPIC FUNDRAISERS A) All funds must be deposited into an A.S. account for holding and will be forwarded to the charitable recipient by A.S. Administration, with the A.S. Ticket Office acting as sole vendor for all sales resulting in revenue to be donated (i.e. tickets for admission, entry fees into sports competitions, etc.). This includes “At the door” ticket sales. A.S. will not fund anything over the actual amount of the charitable contribution. The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 34 SECTION IX: USING A.S. FUNDS – THE A.S. REQUISITION CLAUSE 1. REQUISITIONS A) Requisitions are used to obtain Purchase Orders, cash advances, and checks and to process journal entries (transferring money from one A.S. account to another), thus allowing an organization to access its A.S. funds. Before spending any A.S. funds, a requisition must be filled out, turned in to the A.S. Administration, UCen Room 2537, and the expenditure must be processed and approved before any funds can be spent. (Final approval bears the A.S. Executive Director’s signature.) Requisitions for A.S. checks take approximately 7-10 business days. Therefore, it is best to plan in advance . CLAUSE 2. ESTIMATES A) Receipts and other documentation of purchase (i.e., invoice) must be attached to the requisition prior to the time when the requisition is submitted to the A.S. Administration Office. SECTION X: PURCHASE ORDERS CLAUSE 1. USE OF A PURCHASE ORDER A) A Purchase Order is used when there is something specific to buy from a merchant or a vendor, or if money in the organization’s account is set aside (i.e., an encumbrance) for an expenditure that is anticipated in the future, such as advertising and copying costs. B) A Purchase Order is Associated Students’ promise to pay for approved purchases. The money is committed for a specific purpose, and until the organization releases that money (pays the bill and/or liquidates the encumbrance) it is not available for any other purpose. It is the most efficient way of using A.S. funds CLAUSE 2. PROCESS TO FILL OUT AN A.S. PURCHASE ORDER A) A requisition needs to be filled out before a Purchase Order is valid; HOWEVER, before a Purchase Order can be filled out, it is advisable to find out which vendors will accept Purchase Orders from Associated Students. 1) Most local and on-campus vendors will accept A.S. Purchase Orders. 2) Each of these vendors may have their own requisition forms, which need to be completed and submitted to A.S. Cashier’s"}

Purchase Orders. 2) Each of these vendors may have their own requisition forms, which need to be completed and submitted to A.S. Cashier’s along with the A.S. Requisition. Specific instructions and examples for on-campus vendors are given in the upcoming sections. B) The cost needs to be estimated. Ask for a complete figure including tax, shipping costs, and discounts (if applicable). The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 35 1) The cost is “Total Price” on the requisition. 2) Make sure the P.O. is approved (see previous section) and that a signed copy of the P.O. has been received by the vendor before the item is bought. When you give the merchant the Purchase Order, the bill will be sent to the A.S. Administration Office for them to pay from the organization’s account. C) All Purchase Order requisition forms must have invoices attached, or if digital, printed as an email and attached to the requisition form. CLAUSE 3. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PURCHASE ORDER? WHERE WILL IT GO? A) If the Purchase Order is to be mailed, make sure to indicate this in the box in the lower right-hand corner of the requisition. B) If the Purchase Order is to be picked up, indicate this in the same location. It is also important to include the name and telephone number of the person who will be picking up the Purchase Order, at the A.S. Cashier’s Office, UCen Room 1535. C) If these details are accidentally left unmarked, the signed copy of the Purchase Order will be mailed directly to the vendor, either by U.S. mail or campus mail. D) It is the organization’s responsibility to follow up on all Purchase Order requests. CLAUSE 4. TYPES OF PURCHASE ORDERS A) There are two types of Purchase Orders: 1) CLOSED PURCHASE ORDER – Closed Purchase Orders are for a specific or one-time expenditure, to be used for a specific item or event. a) Examples: Renting equipment from Instructional Development. 2) OPEN PURCHASE ORDER – Open Purchase Orders are for running an account with a vendor. This allows for a purchase for an extended amount of time. b) Examples: Setting up a copying account with A.S. Publications Services. CLAUSE 5. AVAILABILITY A) A Purchase Order takes a minimum of 7-10 business days to process; however, it is highly recommended that the organization check their e-mail the day after the requisition is turned in, just in case it cannot be processed for some reason. The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 36 SECTION XI: CASH ADV ANCES AND CHECKS CLAUSE 1. USE OF A CASH ADVANCE AND CHECK A) A check is used either to pay someone for their services (i.e., a contract or speaker’s fees) or to purchase an item (such as a newsletter subscription) for which a Purchase Order might not be appropriate. A cash advance shall have the same use as a check, except for larger amounts/purchases. B) For all cash advances and check requisitions, you must include the name and full address of the person to whom the check is to be made payable. All documentation must be attached (e.g., a signed performer’s contract) before a check will be issued. If no documentation is attached, the requisition will be returned, and an e-mail message will be sent to the originator to"}

All documentation must be attached (e.g., a signed performer’s contract) before a check will be issued. If no documentation is attached, the requisition will be returned, and an e-mail message will be sent to the originator to pick up the requisition. 1) Note: Should a check be requested by a person or entity who is indebted to Associated Students (for an outstanding cash advance, excessive phone use, etc.), the payee must first go to the A.S. Cashier’s to repay the indebtedness before the check will be released. CLAUSE 2. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CHECK? WHERE WILL IT GO? A) Fill out the lower right-hand corner of the requisition to indicate what the A.S. Administration Office should do with the check. If the check is to be mailed, make sure to indicate this to the A.S. Administration Office. It is also important to include the name and telephone number of the person who will be picking up the check when submitting the requisition. 1) The person picking up the check can be someone other than the person to whom the check is made out. Whoever picks up the check should take some identification with him/her as it must be provided for the check to be given out. 2) It is the organization’s responsibility to follow up on all check requests. CLAUSE 3. AVAILABILITY A) If a check is to be made payable to a speaker or performer for their services, the organization must have an “Associated Students Performance Agreement Form” filled out correctly, including the performer’s social security number, signed by the speaker or performer (or representative) and turned in to the A.S. Cashier’s Office two weeks prior to the performance if the performer wants to be paid at the event. When the signed contract and the requisition for the check to pay the performer has been approved by the Executive Director, the A.S. Administration Office will process the paperwork. Checks are available for pick-up at the A. S. Cashier’s/Ticket Office but allow for a 48-hour turnaround time for all paperwork. The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 37 SECTION XII: JOURNAL ENTRIES AND BUDGET TRANSFERS CLAUSE 1. USES OF A JOURNAL ENTRY A) A journal entry is used when transferring funds from one organization’s A.S. account into another organization’s account. This is done by marking the box “Journal Entry” on the requisition, writing the account name, number and category into which funds will be transferred in the space entitled “Payable to.” If there is a transfer of more than $500.00, in any seven-day period or for any given event, it must be approved by Finance Committee. CLAUSE 2. P AYMENT FOR A.S. SERVICES BY GROUPS USING THEIR A.S. FUNDS A) Groups wishing to use an A.S. service (such as the A.S. Publications Service) encumber for it by filling out a requisition for a Journal Entry. SECTION XIII: HOW TO REQUISITION FOR ON-CAMPUS SERVICES CLAUSE 1. PROCESS A) There are a number of on-campus departments that have their own set of paperwork/ requisitions that need to be filled out and sent to them with an A.S. Purchase Order before the order can be processed. These departments include Central Stores, Transportation Services, Kerr/Instructional Development, and Physical Facilities. All University work order forms must have the organization’s A.S. PERM Number included under “Account Number,” and some require a “Blanket Number,” as well. It is advised to see a Finance"}

SECTION XIII: HOW TO REQUISITION FOR ON-CAMPUS SERVICES CLAUSE 1. PROCESS A) There are a number of on-campus departments that have their own set of paperwork/ requisitions that need to be filled out and sent to them with an A.S. Purchase Order before the order can be processed. These departments include Central Stores, Transportation Services, Kerr/Instructional Development, and Physical Facilities. All University work order forms must have the organization’s A.S. PERM Number included under “Account Number,” and some require a “Blanket Number,” as well. It is advised to see a Finance Committee liaison for further information. On the other hand, UCen Dining Services is one example of on-campus services that does not have this extra set of forms and only an A.S. Purchase Order is needed. In this section there are instructions and examples on how to go about using A.S. funds for the services provided by each of these departments. CLAUSE 2. INSTRUCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT/MEDIA EQUIPMENT A) Instructional Development provides movies, slides, overhead projectors, screens, tape recorders, record players, mixers, portable P.A. systems, amplifiers, microphones and speakers. If the organization plans on using any equipment from Instructional Development (also known as Kerr), it must plan ahead. Kerr requires at least 2 days to process their work orders, and the A.S. Administration Office needs 2 days, so your requisition and work order must be turned in to the A.S. Cashiers and Ticket Office at least 4 days before the organization needs the equipment. First, contact Instructional Development for an “estimated cost” of services and/or equipment. Next, fill out an A.S. Requisition requesting a Purchase Order. Use the “estimated cost” for the total price. Next, fill out a “Media Equipment Work Order.” (See sample and instructions at the end of this manual). Pick up a requisition and a work order form in the Finance Committee Office. After the form and the A.S. Requisition are complete, turn in both of them to the The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 38 A.S. Cashier’s. Allow 4 days for processing. The work order form will be faxed directly by A.S. Administration to Instructional Development. CLAUSE 3. CENTRAL STORES A) Central Stores provides general office supplies. Pick up a Central Stores order form in the A.S. Finance Committee Office. A Central Stores catalog can be used at the A.S. Finance Committee Office. Use this catalog to look up descriptions of stock items, unit of issue, and stock numbers. Use the stock number to look up the price of the item in the price index located in the front of the catalog. It is cheaper to order through Central Stores than it is to purchase items from almost any vendor. There is no tax for items purchased through Central Stores. Completely fill out the Central Stores order form. (See the sample at the back of this manual). On the form under “Account Number,” list the organization’s “A.S. Account Number,” the organization’s “A.S. PERM Number,” and the organization’s “Blanket Number.” If the organization’s “PERM Number” is unknown, see a Finance Committee member. The form must include all of this information. Next fill out an A.S. Requisition and include the total amount of the purchase. When filling out the A.S. Requisition follow the instructions on “How to fill out a requisition.” Submit both the Central Stores order form and the A.S. Requisition to the A.S. Cashier’s. Allow 48 hours for processing. Within 48 hours, the approved Central Stores form along with the Purchase Order will be faxed by A.S. Administration to Central Stores. CLAUSE 4. FURNITURE SERVICES (CENTRAL STORE) A) Furniture Services provides chair/table/staging rental, minor and major moves, and event set-up. In order to ensure the success of your event you need to contact Furniture Services at least"}

FURNITURE SERVICES (CENTRAL STORE) A) Furniture Services provides chair/table/staging rental, minor and major moves, and event set-up. In order to ensure the success of your event you need to contact Furniture Services at least a month before your event. Paperwork should be initiated as soon as possible thereafter. First, contact Central Stores for an estimated cost of services and/or equipment. Fill out an A.S. Requisition for a Purchase Order following the instructions earlier in this manual. Use the “estimated cost” for the total price. Next fill out a Furniture Services Requisition using the instructions given at the back of this manual. Pick up the requisition forms at the Finance Committee Office. After the Furniture Services Requisition and the A.S. Requisition are complete, turn in both of them to the A.S. Cashier’s. Allow 48 hours for processing. The Furniture Services Purchase Order will be faxed by A.S. Administration to Furniture Services. If the organization wants to take the approved signed work order and Purchase Order to Central Stores, make sure the lower right hand corner of the A.S. Requisition has been completed with the first and last name of the person who will be picking up the work order. CLAUSE 5. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES A) If the organization plans on using a University vehicle for travel, it must complete the following steps. It is highly recommended that the organization contact a Finance Committee member for assistance in planning its travel if it has never used A.S. funds for travel. If the proper forms are not completely filled out and the travel duly approved by The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 39 Finance Committee, then the organization will not be permitted to use A.S. funds. Therefore, it is advised to plan at least a month in advance. STEP 1. Call the Central Garage dispatcher to inquire if a vehicle is available for the day and time you will be needing it. Also, find out what the approximate cost will be–charges plus mileage. STEP 2. It is important that there is enough money in the travel category of the organization’s account. If it is not known, look up the current account balance in the ledger available in the Admin Office. If there is not enough money in the travel category and there is a need to transfer $ 400.00 or more into it, then the organization must go before Finance Committee to have the transfer approved. STEP 3. Prepare a “Vehicle Request” form for the Transportation Services Office. Instructions for filling this out are in the last section of this manual. NOTE: One vehicle request must be completed for each vehicle used (i.e., two forms will be needed if two vehicles will be used). Sign on the line “Requested by.” Do not sign by the “Authorized Signature”; leave that space blank for the Executive Director’s signature. STEP 4. Fill out an A.S. Requisition requesting a Purchase Order, which details the Transportation Services request form. Use the estimated amount for charges and mileage as the “Total Amount” on the requisition. A conference announcement, meeting agenda or flyer must also be attached to the A.S. requisition as supporting documentation. STEP 5. Complete the supplementary travel forms, e.g., the Driver’s Contract(s), Passenger List, Transportation Services request forms, etc. (available in the Finance Committee Office). Each driver must complete a “Driver’s Contract.” Each person in the group who plans on"}

Complete the supplementary travel forms, e.g., the Driver’s Contract(s), Passenger List, Transportation Services request forms, etc. (available in the Finance Committee Office). Each driver must complete a “Driver’s Contract.” Each person in the group who plans on driving must fill out a Driver’s Contract and a Release of Liability form. In addition, all passengers must be listed on the “List of Passengers Traveling” form and each must sign a Release of Liability form. No Authorized Purchase Orders, Vehicle Requests Forms, or other travel funds will be released until the Driver and Passenger forms have been received by the Cashier’s Office. These forms are available in the Finance Committee Office. STEP 6. Submit all of the completed paperwork to the mailbox of the Finance Committee Chair (A.S. Main Office) and you will be put on the Finance Committee agenda to obtain travel approval, unless the travel falls into one of the categories defined in Section 6, Clause 7. If you need Finance Committee approval, you must submit one (1) copy of the Travel Request, and one (1) copy of the Driver’s Contract, Passenger List, and Release of Liability form when you turn in the originals of the forms to the A.S. Cashier’s. Keep a copy for your records. A representative of the organization must attend the Finance Committee meeting at which the travel request will be discussed. The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 40 STEP 7. After approval by Finance Committee, and/or the A.S. Executive Director, the A.S. Administration Office will process the travel request. After 48 hours for processing, a copy of the vehicle request(s) will be available to be picked up at the A.S. Cashier’s office. The signed Vehicle Request form and Purchase Order will be needed BEFORE Transportation Services will reserve the vehicle, which is another reason why you need to plan well in advance. Note: If the organization fails to notify transportation services and the A.S. administration office of any vehicle cancellation at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to its scheduled pick-up, the resulting charge will become the liability of the organizations or its individual members. CLAUSE 6. UNIVERSITY POLICY CONCERNING UNIVERSITY VEHICLES A) University vehicles are provided for official University business only and are not to be used for personal or social purposes. Vehicles are reserved, based on justification, on a daily or per trip basis, or in exceptional circumstances, up to a maximum of five days (Monday through Friday). Trips are limited to the State of California. Organizations that misuse University vehicles or violate driving regulations may have their privilege to use University vehicles withdrawn. CLAUSE 7. PHYSICAL F ACILITIES A) Physical Facilities provides electrician services; water, plumbing, and irrigation; dumpsters; grounds clean up; janitorial service, etc. To arrange for services, you must contact Physical Facilities for an estimated cost of services and/or equipment. Physical Facilities generally needs at least a week’s notification to schedule their services; thus, plan on initiating the necessary paperwork at least seven to ten working days in advance. Fill out an A.S. Requisition for a Purchase Order. Use the estimated cost for the total price. Make sure to note on the A.S. requisition the name of the person who gave you the estimated cost. Next, fill out a Physical Facilities work order using the instructions given at the back of this manual. You can pick up the work order form at the Finance Committee Office."}

After the form and the A.S. requisition have been completed, turn them into the A.S. Cashier’s. Allow 48 hours for processing. The work order will be faxed by A.S. Administration to Physical Facilities. CLAUSE 8. THE DAILY NEXUS A) To place an advertisement in the Daily Nexus, call the Nexus to determine the rates for your ad: 1) A full-page ad is 96 inches, a half page ad is 48 inches, and a quarter page ad is 24 inches, and an eight-page ad is 20 inches. A public service announcement is defined as the advertisement for an event on campus that is nonprofit and generally has no ticket sales. Contact the Nexus advertisement office to discuss if The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 41 your event qualifies as a public service announcement. Otherwise, their regular rates will apply. B) Then find out whether space is available in the issue or issues in which you want to run the ad and be sure to ask about the deadline by which the Purchase Order must be received. Complete an A.S. Requisition for a Purchase Order. In the section “Payable to,” write “Daily Nexus.” Under “Description,” be sure to list the purpose of the ad, including applicable details (e.g., date and place of an event to be advertised) as well as the run date for your ad, and use the rate quoted to you by the Nexus as your “Total Price.” Following your group’s three-digit account number on the requisition, the account category (upper right corner of the requisition) which you must use for advertising expense is 7000. Determine in advance that funds are available in that category of your budget. If they are not, a transfer of up to $ 500.00 may be made from another category of your budget by completing an additional requisition for a journal entry (see earlier section). An amount in excess of $ 500.00 will require prior Finance Committee approval. C) Once the A.S. Requisition has been completed payable to the Daily Nexus, submit the requisition to the A.S. Cashier’s. Allow a minimum of 48 hours for processing. The Daily Nexus will not place your ad without an approved Associated Students purchase order. It is vital that the organization plan ahead, by submitting the requisition a minimum of three days before the deadline which the nexus sets for accepting ads for the run date of your ad. When the A.S. Administration Office completes the Purchase Order that has been requisitioned, they will send it directly to the Nexus. Consequently, if 48 hours are needed for processing of your A.S. Requisition, you should be able to go to the Nexus office to place your ad and find the Purchase Order number which they required has already been received. Nonetheless, allow ample time to arrange for the ad and don’t wait until the last minute. CLAUSE 9. CENTRAL STORES MAIL SERVICE A) If the organization wants to send out a one-time mailing of 200 or more pieces of identical mail, or 50 pounds of identical matter, then bulk mailing should be used.

The guidelines for preparation of bulk- rate third class mailings and basic sorting instructions are available at the Finance Committee Office. These guidelines are applicable to direct, 3-digit, state, and “mixed states” mailings. The stamps, rubber bands, and stampings are done at Central Stores. Final preparations of the mailing should be done at Central Stores. If your organization wishes to use an off-campus mailing service, a Control Number, available at Central Stores, must be used. Call Mail Services at Central Stores if there are any additional questions or to find out what restrictions apply. A separate A.S. Requisition for a Purchase Order made payable to “Regents/Central Stores” must be completed in order to encumber funds for the postal charges before the bulk mail may be sent. Remember to include your A.S. PERM Number in the Description area of the requisition. Each one-time mailing will require a separate P.O., since Mail Services cannot set up an “Open P.O.” system. The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 42 CLAUSE 10. SANTA BARBARA TRAVEL BUREAU A) If the organization wishes to use the service of Santa Barbara Travel Bureau and wants to purchase the lowest airfare available for you, these guidelines must be followed for domestic travel: STEP 1. Fill out a Purchase Order requisition at least one month before your departure date and obtain travel approval from Finance Committee before doing anything else! STEP 2. After the Finance Committee has approved the travel, make the airline reservation. Days of travel for the lowest fare are Monday through Thursdays or staying over a Saturday night. If paying by a Purchase Order, Santa Barbara Travel Bureau strongly suggests that you make a reservation first, and hold the seats. Even though a seat is being held and a quote given, the airlines have the right to change times and prices at any time. The only way to secure a price is to purchase at the same time as the reservation. STEP 3. Be careful to differentiate refundable and non-refundable tickets. Non- refundable tickets cannot be changed after purchase. STEP 4. If there are any further questions concerning purchasing a ticket from Santa Barbara Travel Bureau, call 805-969-7746. CLAUSE 11. F AST ACCESS/BOOKSTORE PURCHASES A) FAST Access Cards can be used at the UCSB Bookstore for office supplies. To request a FAST Access card, please complete an A.S. requisition made payable to University Center (UCen) “FAST Access.” Please be sure to indicate on the requisition a “Contact Person.” This person will be required to sign for the card upon issuance and will be responsible for the use of the card. Should the card be lost or stolen, the contact person must notify the University Center immediately. In order for another card to be issued, there is a UCEN service charge of $5.00 for which the individual using the card would be responsible and if there are any charges incurred during the time of the loss and the notification of the loss to the UCen, the individual would also be responsible for those. Cards can be picked up at the A.S. Cashier’s seven (7) working days after the requisition has been turned in and approved.

Consistent with the above purposes, such reallocations shall only be made to support either the general organizational expenses of Registered Campus Organizations and Registered Campus Organization-related programs and activities or their associated communicative purposes. In addition, allocation decisions to provide such support must be made without regard to the viewpoint of a particular Registered Campus Organization or Registered Campus Organization- related program or activity, and must be balanced in relation to the support provided to other Registered Campus Organizations or Registered Campus Organization-related programs and activities in similar circumstances. 86.30 CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA TO ASSURE VIEWPOINT NEUTRALITY In fulfilling these purposes consistent with applicable law and Section 86.20 of these Policies, campuses shall have responsibility for ensuring that student governments and, as applicable, other campus reallocation entities, maintain procedures and criteria for making specific reallocation decisions for the support of Registered Campus Organizations and Registered Campus Organization-related programs and activities from compulsory campus-based student fees. Such procedures and criteria must be viewpoint-neutral in their nature; that is, they must be based upon considerations which do not include approval or disapproval of the viewpoint of the Registered Campus Organization or any of its related programs or activities. 86.31 CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA TO ASSURE VIEWPOINT NEUTRALITY Criteria appropriate to be given balanced consideration in the making of viewpoint-neutral reallocation decisions might include, but are not limited to: the objectively documented organizational needs of the Registered Campus Organization based on membership size; its office or equipment requirements; the extent of financial support the Registered Campus Organization receives from other sources; or the production costs associated with a particular event or series of events the Registered Campus Organization typically sponsors. Such sponsored events supported in whole or in part by compulsory campus-based student fees need not avoid controversial political, religious, or ideological content, subject to the understanding that under current University policy (see Section 30.20 of the Policy on Speech and Advocacy) campuses have a responsibility to assure an ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints. 86.32 CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA TO ASSURE VIEWPOINT NEUTRALITY Campus procedures and criteria shall provide: (a) that student governments or other campus entities responsible for reallocating compulsory campus-based student fees must publicize widely and regularly to Registered Campus Organizations the availability of such funds to support Registered Campus Organizations on a viewpoint-neutral basis, as well as the viewpoint- neutral criteria on the basis of which such funds will be reallocated; and (b) that communications to Registered Campus Organizations on the"}

The Financial Policies & Procedures of Associated Students 52 86.33 CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA TO ASSURE VIEWPOINT NEUTRALITY Campus criteria and procedures shall also provide for: (a) documentation of all funding processes available to Registered Campus Organizations, including notice of the opportunity to apply for funding and the criteria upon which funding requests will be judged, consistent with Section 86.32 of these Policies; (b) documentation of all funding requests by Registered Campus Organizations and actions taken by the student government or other campus entity with reference to the published funding criteria in response to such requests; and (c) a formal process that allows Registered Campus Organizations or individual students to appeal, in a reasonable and timely manner, funding decisions regarding particular Registered Campus Organizations or Registered Campus Organization-related programs and activities made by the student government or other campus reallocating entity. 86.34 CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA TO ASSURE VIEWPOINT NEUTRALITY Compulsory campus-based student fees may be reallocated to pay for speakers sponsored by Registered Campus Organizations. Over time, such events should stimulate on-campus discussion and debate from a wide range of viewpoints on a variety of issues. 86.40 LEGAL REVIEW OF CAMPUS PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA Campus procedures and criteria for reallocation of compulsory campus-based student fees to support Registered Campus Organizations and Registered Campus Organization-related programs and activities on a viewpoint-neutral basis must be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel to ensure that the procedures and criteria are consistent with the law and these Policies. In addition, campuses are advised to consult with the Office of the General Counsel should a question arise about whether a particular reallocation is viewpoint- neutral in nature and meets the University’s educational purposes as specified in Section 86.20 of these Policies. 87.00 TRANSFER OF COMPULSORY CAMPUS-BASED STUDENT FEES TO NON- UNIVERSITY ENTITIES Compulsory campus-based student fees may be expended by a student government, Registered Campus Organization, or other campus entity to cover the expenses of direct participation by University students in a particular non-University-sponsored educational program or activity. Such fees may also be expended in payment of applicable dues necessary to sustain membership by a student government or Registered Campus Organization in national and other regional non- University associations at the basic level established by such associations, so long as the level of any such assessment is in line with what is assessed similar student organizations at other institutions comparable in size and nature to the University as a requirement of basic membership. Except as provided immediately below, memberships at a preferential level that require the payment of higher periodic dues than what is required to sustain basic membership, or the assessment by such non-University associations of supplemental contributions from their members as an expectation but not a requirement of continued membership, may not be supported from compulsory campus-based student fees.

Any purchase using University funds must directly benefit the overall need of your department or the University, not the individual(s) requesting the purchase. US Law states that government funds shall not be expended for items intended solely for personal convenience or to satisfy the personal desire of an employee or employees. As a co-equal branch of the California government, UCSB is considered a government entity. All funds coming into the UC are considered taxpayer funds, regardless of the source. Such funds belong to the University, not an individual. *Items like those above fall into the category of \"luxury items\", unless they specifically contribute to the fulfillment of the mission of the teaching, research, or public service being conducted for University purposes. If your department can justify that the acquisition ensures the University receives the primary benefit of the expenditure, and meets the University’s mission, your purchase should be supported with sufficient documentation. These purchases do not need to come through or be approved by Campus Purchasing.” In acknowledging and understanding this memo, AS UCSB can justify the acquisition of the purchased goods or services for which this letter is attached to because we have confirmed that the University receives the primary benefit of the purchase item(s). More specifically, the purchase item(s) greatly benefits the undergraduate student life and experience found at UC Santa Barbara. For our record, goods will be kept in the space designated above for easy access when future use is required, and to ensure that the purchased item(s) are not benefiting a singular individual. Purchases like these are vetted through a multi-step process, incorporating UC policy, student perspectives and guidance, and career staff approval checks. This process ensures that we can achieve our goal as a unit while adhering to the UC policies that govern our operations.
