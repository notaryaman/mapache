      If your landlord hasn‚Äôt returned your deposit, here‚Äôs the short path ‚Äî from your friendly campus raccoon ü¶ù:
      California generally requires return of the deposit (or an itemized deductions letter) within 21 days after move-out. Keep your lease, photos from move-out, and any messages. The A.S. Legal Resource Center can help you write a demand letter and walk you through next steps if there‚Äôs no response.
